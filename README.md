# Deel FE Exercise

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run the project

In the project directory, start by installing npm dependencies with the following command

### `npm ci`


After successfully installing the required dependencies, run the project with the following command\

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Notes
I've used create-react-app because it would take too long to setup webpack, babel, and typescript manually.

Everything is commited at once on this exercise, but on a real feature I would make multiple commits that are meaninfull and would simplify the code review.
